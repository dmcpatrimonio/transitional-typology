## Evolution and Adaptations ##

Traditional towns in Portugal and Brazil have evolved, since the
thirteenth century, a finely tuned coordination between, on the one
hand, modular dimensions for street widths and lot sizes, and on the
other, a typology of room shapes and distributions within houses.
Despite being well documented in urban history, this coordination was,
during the past century, often interpreted as contingent and as a
result of the limited material means of pre-industrial societies.
Nevertheless, the continued application and gradual adaptation of
these urban and architectural patterns throughout periods of
industrialization and economic development suggests they respond to
both long-lasting housing requirements and piecemeal urban growth.
This article surveys the persistence of urban and architectural
patterns up to the early twentieth century, showing their resilience in
addressing the requirements of modern housing and urbanisation.
